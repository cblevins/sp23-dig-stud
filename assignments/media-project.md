In this project you will take a similar approach as the Zoom Presentation, in which you will research and communicate how technology (broadly defined) has changed or otherwise influenced a specific aspect of society in the past five years. This time, you will be communicating your research through a different medium: through a visual poster, a mini "podcast" episode, or a short video. The topic needs to be different from you original Zoom presentation, but once again should have a clear message or interpretation about the technology's impact and use concrete, compelling examples to illustrate the change. The goal of this assignment is for you to, as much as possible, move away from a written style of communication and to experiment with how you can best use your chosen medium of communication to convey information. Your submission should include a post on your website sandbox that includes a short reflection on the process (how you approached it, challenges you ran into, strategies you used, etc.) along with the sources you consulted. 

*Submit the file of your project and a URL to your reflection post on Canvas, due April 19th by 11:59PM*
