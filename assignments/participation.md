title: Participation
---

The participation portion of this course involves several components:

- Support each other: behave professionally and respectfully, and always assume the best.
- Actively participate in discussions, activities, and any other elements of the class - both in person and online.
- For discussions, this means making observations and asking questions that help the class think together. For hands-on activities and workshops, this means making a good-faith effort to complete the activity and helping your peers to do so as well if they are struggling.  
- Complete [an initial student survey](https://forms.gle/7hmWnBkemDbtTnLc9) at the beginning of the semester (**due January 27th**)
- Meet with Professor Blevins for 10 min. during the first month of the semester (**by Feburary 17th**) so that I can get to know you and learn more about your goals and interests for this course ([use Find Appointment tool on Canvas Calendar](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-sign-up-for-a-Scheduler-appointment-in-the-Calendar/ta-p/536)).
