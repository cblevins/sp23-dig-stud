title: Data Exploration
---

### Assignment Overview
Your assignment is to explore the following historical dataset and write a post about it on a page on your website: <https://repository.upenn.edu/mead/22/>. I am not providing you with any additional information about the dataset beyond the above link. You will need to put on your detective hats and try to familiarize yourself with the data. Download and open the file, look at the metadata from the website, and try to get a handle on what it is.

### Data Biography
In the first part of your post you will write a short "data biography." Read Heather Krause, ["Data Biographies: Getting to Know Your Data"](https://gijn.org/2017/03/27/data-biographies-getting-to-know-your-data/) *Global Investigative Journalism Network* (March 27, 2017) then follow Krause's example to address the following:

- **Introduce** the dataset and its contents. Use a screenshot or two to illustrate some of its features.
- **Where** did it come from?
- **Who** collected it?
- **How** was it collected?
- **Why** was it collected?

### Data Analysis and Visualization
You will then use Tableau Public to explore the contents of the dataset in more depth and the kinds of information it contains. Once you have a handle on the different kinds of information, choose a **specific** aspect of the data to analyze and visualize in some way (chart, map, etc.). Communicate your findings in the second part of your post, through a combination of written explanation and either exported images from your Tableau Public workbook or an [embedded Tableau Public sheet](https://perceptivedata.com.au/embed-tableau-in-website/) in your post.
