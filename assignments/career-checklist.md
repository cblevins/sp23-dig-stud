- Add a [resume page to your website]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/resume-website/). Post the URL of your site to Canvas.
- Make a LinkedIn profile, [connect with Professor Blevins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameronblevins/) and submit a link to your LinkedIn profile on Canvas.
- Schedule a one-on-one meeting with the Career Center and write a short two-paragraph reflection on your experience.
- Attend a job fair or other career-related event outside of class.
