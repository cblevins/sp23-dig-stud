title: Perusall Annotations
---

We will be using the social annotation platform Perusall for many of the semester's readings. Rather than passively reading something, in Perusall you will add comments and questions linked to specific passages of a reading. You will then be able to read and reply to your classmates' comments on the same document, creating a conversation on the day's topics prior to the start of class. All readings that require annotation will be flagged in the [Course Schedule](({{site.baseurl}}/schedule)). 

Unless otherwise noted in Perusall, you should leave at least **four annotations** for each annotation. Your comments can go in any direction you like, but should engage directly with the content of the reading and connect it to larger themes we've discussed in class, assignments, material from other classes, or your own experiences. Finally, I encourage you to engage directly with each other rather just writing stand-alone comments. You can read other comments left by members of your group, and you can "upvote" your classmates's comments or reply to them directly using the @mention function.

The first time you open Perusall you will need to do so through the course Canvas site. Once you've connected Canavas to Perusall you you should be able to directly go to the [course Perusall page](https://app.perusall.com/courses/intro-to-digital-studies-spring-2023/).
