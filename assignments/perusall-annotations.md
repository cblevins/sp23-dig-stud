title: Perusall Annotations
---

We will be using the social annotation platform Perusall for many of the semester's readings. Rather than passively reading something, in Perusall you will add comments and questions linked to specific passages of a reading. You will then be able to read and reply to your classmates' comments on the same document, creating a conversation on the day's topics prior to the start of class. All readings that require annotation will be flagged in the [Course Schedule](({{site.baseurl}}/schedule)) and you can access them through the [class Perusall page]().

Note: Perusall typically grades the "quality" of your annotations based on a variety of factors.
