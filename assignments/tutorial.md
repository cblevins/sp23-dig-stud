*Note: only for graduate students signed up for HIST 5260 or COMM 6710.*

You will choose a discrete technical skill or task and build a tutorial that teaches someone how to learn it. This can take the form of a written tutorial, a recorded video screencast, or any other format you feel would be most effective for conveying that skill. The technical task itself can be whatever you like (including applications, software, or techniques not covered in this course), but it should be narrow and discrete. Ie. Rather than making a tutorial on "How to edit photos in Adobe Photoshop" you would do something like ["How to blur a photo background in Photoshop using blur masks and depth masks"](https://photoshopcafe.com/blur-photo-background-photoshop-using-blur-masks-depth-maps/). You can consult existing tutorials, but your own tutorial needs to be original content - ie. it should be in your own words and use your own material. The goal of this assignment is to help you understand how to not just how to communicate, but specifically to teach or train someone how to learn a technical skill.

*Submit the URL or upload the file of your tutorial on Canvas anytime during the semester up through May 12th.*
