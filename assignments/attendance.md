title: Attendance
---

- Attend each class on time and prepared for discussion and in-class activities
- There are roughly thirty classes in the semester and I don't expect or require perfect attendance. You do, however, need to be contributing to the classroom community, which is not going to be possible if you miss too many classes. 
- If you need to miss class, please send a message to *both* Whitney Roberts and Professor Blevins and review the material or workshops to get caught up prior to the next class. 
- You can check how many classes you've attended and missed through [Canvas Roll Call](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-view-my-Roll-Call-Attendance-report-as-a-student/ta-p/354).
