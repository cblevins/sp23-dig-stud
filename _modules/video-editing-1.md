title: Video Editing with Adobe Premiere I
---

## Introduction

The goal of today is continue to learn how to use the video editing software Adobe Premiere Pro. You are going to use this software to create a short (**roughly two-minute**) promotional video for this class.

## Your building blocks

Download the .zip file posted to the `#in-class` Slack channel according to your group number:

- Groups 1 & 2: `files-01`
- Groups 3 & 4: `files-02`
- Groups 5 & 6: `files-03`

Extract your zip file ([Windows instructions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/zip-and-unzip-files-f6dde0a7-0fec-8294-e1d3-703ed85e7ebc#:~:text=Open%20File%20Explorer%20and%20find,folder%20to%20a%20new%20location.), [Mac instructions](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/zip-and-unzip-files-and-folders-on-mac-mchlp2528/mac#:~:text=unzip%20(expand)%20a%20compressed%20item)) and move the enclosed folder of files (ex. `files-01`) to your `video-editing` folder. Inside this folder you will have the "building blocks" for making your video:

- Several short videos each of you recorded (.mp4 files)
- Image to use as a video background (background-image.jpeg)
- Image of the class (zoom-screenshot.png)
- Audio file with music sample (.mp3 file)

## Things to include

Your goal is to create a short promo video using the above building blocks that includes the following:

- Create and save a new project in Adobe Premiere Pro in your `video-editing` folder on your computer
- Choose **three video clips** recorded by your classmates to include in your promo (you don't have to go through all of them).
- Import the two video files, the two image files (.jpeg/.png), and audio file (.mp3) into your project.
- Add the `background-image` to your Timeline and have it play for the first **6 seconds** of your video.
- Add the **audio file** to the Timeline so that it plays during those opening 6 seconds and then stops (you'll want to trim it in the Timeline).
- Add **three text objects** using the `Essential Graphics` panel so that they are overlaid onto the image during the opening **6 seconds** of the video:
  - Introduction to Digital Studies
  - HIST 3260/5260 - COMM 3081/5081
  - Professor Blevins - Spring 2023
- Change **the font** of your text objects to `Impact` and adjust the size, position, and color of your text objects to be easily legible to the viewer.
- Add the **three videos clips** of your classmates to the Timeline so that they appear immediately *after* the opening six seconds
- **Trim several seconds** from the beginning and/or end of each of the video clips  (ex. if there are several seconds of awkward silence at the beginning or end).
- Add a `Wipe transition` between your opening six second still image and the first video. You may need to display the `Effects` panel under `Window`
- Add **a 2-second transition** between the different sections of your videos, such as the opening image and in between your videos. You may need to display the `Effects` panel under `Window`
- End your video with **3 seconds** of the `zoom-screenshot` image.
- **Rotate** the zoom-screenshot image of the class so that it's at a **45-degree angle**. (You may need to show the `Effect Controls` panel under `Window`).
- Add a **text object** to the last 3 seconds of the still image that says `Introduction to Digital Studies`
- **Export your project** content as a single new video file using the settings Format: `H.264` and Match Source: `Adaptive Medium Bitrate`. Make sure to rename the Output Name to `yourfirstname-yourlastname-promo.mp4` and upload it to the `#in-class` Slack channel *as a Reply in Thread to Professor Blevins post today*.

**Bonus:**
- Add an audio fade-in and fade-out for the transitions between the opening music and each of the video files ([Tutorial](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/audio-transitions.html))
