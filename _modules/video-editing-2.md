title: Video Editing with Adobe Premiere II
---

## Introduction

The goal of today is continue to learn how to use the video editing software Adobe Premiere Pro. You are going to use this software to create a **1-2 minute video montage**: "Pets of Intro to Digital Studies." I'm intentionally leaving the instructions a bit more open-ended - I would encourage you to explore and troubleshoot any problems you run into together.

## Your building blocks

Download the .zip file posted to the `#in-class` Slack channel and extract it to a sub-folder in your computer's folder for this class ([Windows instructions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/zip-and-unzip-files-f6dde0a7-0fec-8294-e1d3-703ed85e7ebc#:~:text=Open%20File%20Explorer%20and%20find,folder%20to%20a%20new%20location.), [Mac instructions](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/zip-and-unzip-files-and-folders-on-mac-mchlp2528/mac#:~:text=unzip%20(expand)%20a%20compressed%20item)). In this folder I've included some still image and video files of your pets that you've posted to Slack along with an audio file to use as background music.

## Record A Video of Yourself

You're going to record a short video file of yourself introducing the rest of the video using your laptop's built-in camera. Something like: "Hi there and welcome to pets of Intro to Digital Studies!" There are several ways to do this:

- [Zoom](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362473-Enabling-and-starting-local-recordings)
- [Quicktime (Mac)](https://support.apple.com/guide/quicktime-player/record-a-movie-qtp356b55534/mac)
- [Camera app (Windows)](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/how-to-use-the-camera-app-ea40b69f-be6a-840e-9c8c-1fd6eea97c22)
- [Camera app (Chromebook)](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/4487486)

If your laptop camera is broken, you can also record it to your mobile device and then transfer the video file to your laptop.

## Things to include in your video montage

Your goal is to create a short video that includes as much of the following as possible:

- A mix of videos (including your recorded video of yourself), audio, images, and overlaid text (ex. "Pets of Intro to Digital Studies")
- Other things you can try to include:
	- Use the [Razor Tool](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/rearranging-clips-sequence.html#:~:text=you%20can%20use%20the%20razor%20tool%20to%20cut%20a%20clip%20into%20two%20clips) to split one video in half, then place one of the images a pet in between the two split video segments.
	- Add a Cross Disolve transition between two different videos ([Tutorial](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/transition-overview-applying-transitions.html))
	- Add an audio fade-in and/or fade-out ([Tutorial](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/audio-transitions.html))
- Export your project content as a single new video file using the settings Format: `H.264` and Preset: `Match Source - Adaptive Medium Bitrate`. Make sure to rename the Output Name to `yourlastname-pets.mp4` 
- Upload it to the `#in-class` Slack channel.
