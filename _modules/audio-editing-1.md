title: Audio Editing I
---

### Overview

You will be working in pairs today to learn how to use the open-source software Audacity to edit audio. The goal is to have a roughly one minute recording where you discuss ideas for what you'd like to do for your media project.

### Part I: Recording 

As a group we are going to watch 1:00-4:30 of Pat Flynn's ["How to Record and Edit a Podcast in Audacity (Complete Tutorial)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl-WDjWrTtk). Open up Audacity and follow along. Open the [written manual here](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/record.html) for reference.

You are going to record a short conversation in pairs using Audacity in which you ask each other the following prompt: "What are you thinking about doing for your media project?" Choose **one of your ideas** that you wrote down on your notecard.

Things to review before starting to record:

- Make a new folder inside your `tutorials` class folder and name the folder `audio-editing`.
- Start a new project and save it as `audio-editing-1` under your new `audio-editing` folder.
- Make sure to set the correct Recording Device
- Click in the `Recording Meter` and make sure that the microphone is picking up audio.
- Position your laptop as best you can so that you're talking into it while also being able to converse with your partner
- `Record` your conversation on both laptops (shoot for a maximum of 1-2 minutes). 
- When you are done recording, each person [export the audio as a MP3 file](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/export.html) named `yourfirstname-yourlastname-audio-1a.mp3` and then share that .mp3 file with the other person over Slack DM.
- Save your partner's .mp3 file in `audio-editing` folder. 
- Import your partner's audio file into your project by going to File > Import > Audio... and selecting the file

### Part II: Editing

Watch 5:00-11:15 of Pat Flynn's ["How to Record and Edit a Podcast in Audacity (Complete Tutorial)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl-WDjWrTtk).

Then try to do all of the the following in Audacity:

- Mute your partner's track in your project ([instructions](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/audio_tracks.html#panel)) and then "scrub" through to listen to parts of your your recorded track.
- Do the same with your partner's track (muting your track)
- Notice that your laptop did a much better job of picking up the parts of your conversation when *you* were speaking and vice versa with your partner's laptop.
- Use the [Selection Tool](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/selecting_audio_the_basics.html) to delete or cut the sections from your two tracks in which the *other* person is speaking (so that *your* track only plays *your* voice, and your partner's track only plays *their* voice). 
- Use the Selection Tool to move each track so that they play back to back
- Use the [Envelope Tool](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/envelope_tool.html) to adjust the volume of your tracks or specific parts of each track so they're relatively even (ie. one is not louder than the other)
- [Export your edited audio](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/file_menu_export.html) as an .mp3 file called `yourfirstname-yourlastname-audio-1b.mp3`
- `Reply in thread` to Prof. Blevins's post in the `#in-class` channel today and upload your recorded .mp3 file
