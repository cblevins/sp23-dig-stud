- You're going to be installing Wordpress on Reclaim Hosting that you will be using as your personal website over the course of the semester and beyond. During the semester, you're going to use this Wordpress site as a way to learn different skills and create assignments. At the end of the semester, we'll go over how to transition this website into a portfolio website that you can use a public-facing site.

:rotating_light: :rotating_light: :rotating_light: When you install Wordpress through Reclaim Hosting it will ask you to choose an Administrator username and password. This is not the same as your username and password for Reclaim Hosting! **Remember to write down this separate username and password so you can log into your Wordpress installation moving forward.** :rotating_light: :rotating_light: :rotating_light:

- Now go to these instructions to install: <https://community.reclaimhosting.com/t/installing-wordpress/265>. 

Once you've finished, go back to Reclaim Hosting's `File Manager` and open `public_html`. You should now see a new folder called `website`. If you look inside here, you will see a bunch of new folders and files that were automatically generated to "build" your Wordpress site. This means you should have a Wordpress website installed under `http://yourdomainname/`. Try going to this URL in a new web browser and make sure it works.

To actually start modifying your website, you will be logging in to the Wordpress dashboard (separate from Reclaim Hosting). The login page will be: `http://yourdomainname/wp-admin`, and you will use the Administrator username and password you specified when you installed Wordpress. Visit this URL and make sure that you are able to log in to the Wordpress dashboard before the start of class. You don't need to do anything, but make sure you are able to log in.
