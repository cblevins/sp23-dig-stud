title: Audio Editing II
---

## Overview

The goal of today is to stitch together an audio file of examples of students' ideas for their media project, interspersed with music and sound effects. It should incorporate the following components:

- Brief musical introduction
- Main audio of project ideas
- A personal sign-off with a sound effect

## Your building blocks

- If you haven't done so already, make a new folder inside your `tutorials` class folder and name the folder `audio-editing`.
- Download the .zip file posted to the `#in-class` Slack channel according to your group number:
	- Groups 1 & 2: `files-01`
	- Groups 3 & 4: `files-02`
	- Groups 5 & 6: `files-03`
- Extract your zip file ([Windows instructions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/zip-and-unzip-files-f6dde0a7-0fec-8294-e1d3-703ed85e7ebc#:~:text=Open%20File%20Explorer%20and%20find,folder%20to%20a%20new%20location.), [Mac instructions](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/zip-and-unzip-files-and-folders-on-mac-mchlp2528/mac#:~:text=unzip%20(expand)%20a%20compressed%20item)) and move the enclosed folder of files (ex. `files-01`) to your `audio-editing` folder. 
- Inside this folder you will find several audio recordings of your media project ideas (.mp3 files).
- Download [this rockin' banjo music]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/heftone-banjo-orchestra-whistling-rufus.mp3) and save it under your `audio-editing` folder. Note: you might need to right-click on the link to download/save the file.

## Putting it Together

- Start a new project and save it as `audio-editing-2` under your `audio-editing` folder.
- Import all the .mp3 files you just downloaded of your classmate project ideas and make sure they're added as new tracks
- Import the banjo music .mp3 file and add it as a new track
- [Select and trim](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/audacity_tracks_and_clips.html) the banjo music audio track so that you have a roughly 10-second musical intro.
- Use the [Selection Tool](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/selecting_audio_the_basics.html) to rearrange the order of your project ideas so that the first one begins towards the end of the banjo music, with some overlap
- Use the [Envelope Tool](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/envelope_tool.html) to fade the song out as it leads up to the conversation.
- Use the [Selection Tool](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/selecting_audio_the_basics.html) and delete or cut any leading or trailing dead sound or long silences in your recorded tracks of project ideas.
- Use the [Envelope Tool](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/envelope_tool.html) to adjust the volume of each your tracks or specific parts of each track so they're relatively even
- Record a *new* audio track in which you record a few seconds of a "sign off" or goodbye to end your recording.
- Download a sound effect from [Quick Sounds](https://quicksounds.com/) and overlay it onto your sign off at the end of your recording.
- [Export your edited audio](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/file_menu_export.html) as a .mp3 file called `yourlastname-yourfirstname.mp3` and upload it to the `#in-class` Slack channel.
