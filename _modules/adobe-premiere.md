## Working with Turtle Videos

To put your new skills into practice, you're going to make a short video that has turtles in it. 

- Start a new project in Premiere and save it as `intro-premiere.prproj`
- Download the following .zip file to your course folder on your computer by right-clicking on the link and selecting Save as (or save target as): [premiere-videos.zip]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/premiere-videos.zip). 
- Extract the contents of the .zip file ([Windows instructions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/zip-and-unzip-files-f6dde0a7-0fec-8294-e1d3-703ed85e7ebc#:~:text=Open%20File%20Explorer%20and%20find,folder%20to%20a%20new%20location.), [Mac instructions](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/zip-and-unzip-files-and-folders-on-mac-mchlp2528/mac#:~:text=unzip%20(expand)%20a%20compressed%20item)).
- The extracted .zip folder has four files:
  - duck-and-cover-intro.mp4
  - tmnj.gif
  - led-zepplin.mp3 
  - turtle-walking.mp4
- Import all four media files into your project and make sure they are appearing in your Project Panel
- Use the Source Monitor Panel to preview each file (three videos and one music)
- Add the Duck and Cover video to your Timeline
- Trim the Duck and Cover clip so that it ends on second 48 with the title screen "Duck and Cover"
- Add the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles video clip to the Timeline 
- Arrange the TMNJ clip so that it appears *after* the end of your newly trimmed Duck and Cover video
- Add the video of a turtle walking to your Timeline
- Add the audio of a sample of Led Zepplin's "Immigrant Song" to your Timeline (led-zepplin.mp3) so that it appears *under* the video of a turtle walking
- Trim the end of the video of the turtle walking so that the video ends with the end of the audio from Led Zepplin
- Export your project content as a single new video file using the settings Format: `H.264` and Match Source: `Medium Bitrate`. Make sure to rename the Output Name to `my-first-video.mp4`/modules/
