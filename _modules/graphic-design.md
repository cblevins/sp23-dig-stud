- Go to `Hands-on tutorials` -> `Orientation` and go through the following tutorials:
	- Discover How Illustrator Art is Unique
	- Take a Tour of the App

## Create a Course Flyer

To put your new skills into practice, you're going to design a basic flyer for this class. 

- Navigate on your computer to your `intro-digital-studies` folder you created in the [Files and Folders]({{site.baseurl}}modules/files-folders/) tutorial earlier in the semester. If you haven't done so already, create a `tutorials` folder inside this folder.
- Make a new folder inside your `tutorials` folder named `graphic-design`
- Download the following Adobe Illustrator file and put it inside your new `graphic-design` folder: [course-flyer.ai]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/course-flyer.ai).

Open `course-flyer.ai` in Illustrator and complete the following:

* Change the blue background to black
* Add text for the course title, meeting place, and meeting time (get this from the course website) onto the white background and change the color and font to something *other* than the default.
* Change the text size so the course title is the largest piece of text
* Add text objects listing some of the skills you've learned in the class so far and place this text on top of the black part of the background
* Move and resize the CU icon so that it is anchored to the bottom left corner
