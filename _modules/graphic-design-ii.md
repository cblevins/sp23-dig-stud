title: Graphic Design with Adobe Illustrator II
---

Today you will be continuing to learn the basics of Adobe Illustrator.

## Tutorials

You're going to complete two tutorials to help familiarize yourself with Illustrator's interface. A few notes about these tutorials before you start. 

- Both of these are available inside Adobe's app. One of the advantages of doing them inside the app is that it will guide you to different parts of the interface. However, the videos are a little small and don't have Closed Captioning for non-English languages. To access them through the app, navigate to `Help` -> `Tutorials` -> `Get started with Illustrator`.
- Each will require you to download a .zip file to your computer that contains some files you'll need to open in Illustrator. Download the .zip file and put it into the `graphic-design` folder on your computer that you created in the [Graphic Design in Adobe Illustrator I tutorial]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/graphic-design/). Then **follow [these instructions](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/how-to-unzip-files) to unzip the folder so you can access the files.** If you skip this step you won't be able to follow along on the tutorials.
- Complete the following tutorials:

1. [Get to know Illustrator](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/how-to/ai-basics-fundamentals.html) (17 min.)
2. [Transform and edit artwork](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/how-to/edit-artwork-basics.html) (19 min.)
