title: Graphic Design with Adobe Illustrator II
---

Today you will be continuing to learn the basics of Adobe Illustrator.

## Tutorials

You're going to complete two tutorials to help familiarize yourself with Illustrator's interface. A few notes about these tutorials before you start. 

- Both of these are available inside Adobe's app. One of the advantages of doing them inside the app is that it will guide you to different parts of the interface. However, the videos are a little small and don't have Closed Captioning for non-English languages. To access them through the app, navigate to `Help` -> `Tutorials` -> `Get started with Illustrator`.
- Each will require you to download a .zip file to your computer that contains some files you'll need to open in Illustrator. Download the .zip file and put it into the `graphic-design` folder on your computer that you created in the [Graphic Design in Adobe Illustrator I tutorial]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/graphic-design/). Then **follow [these instructions](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/how-to-unzip-files) to unzip the folder so you can access the files.** If you skip this step you won't be able to follow along on the tutorials.
- Complete the following tutorials:

1. [Get to know Illustrator](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/how-to/ai-basics-fundamentals.html) (17 min.)
2. [Transform and edit artwork](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/how-to/edit-artwork-basics.html) (19 min.)

## Create a Course Flyer

To put your new skills into practice, you're going to design a basic flyer for this class. 

- Navigate on your computer to your `intro-digital-studies` folder you created in the [Files and Folders]({{site.baseurl}}modules/files-folders/) tutorial earlier in the semester. If you haven't done so already, create a `tutorials` folder inside this folder.
- Make a new folder inside your `tutorials` folder named `graphic-design`
- Download the following Adobe Illustrator file and put it inside your new `graphic-design` folder: [course-flyer.ai]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/course-flyer.ai).

Open `course-flyer.ai` in Illustrator and complete the following:

* Change the blue background to black
* Add text for the course title, meeting place, and meeting time (get this from the course website) onto the white background and change the color and font to something *other* than the default.
* Change the text size so the course title is the largest piece of text
* Add text objects listing some of the skills you've learned in the class so far and place this text on top of the black part of the background
* Move and resize the CU icon so that it is anchored to the bottom left corner

Use
* **Bonus**: see if you can figure out how to download and add [this vector image](https://www.vecteezy.com/vector-art/165951-free-linear-electronics-and-digital-devices) to the course flyer.
