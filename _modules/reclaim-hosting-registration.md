As part of this course you will be creating your own personal website that you will use during the semester for assignments and, eventually, to create a portfolio of your work that you can showcase after the semester ends. Rather than give you an account hosted by CU Denver (which you would lose access to after graduation), I have chosen to use Reclaim Hosting - a company explicitly geared towards giving students and others in education control over their own space.

Follow these instructions to register for an account with Reclaim Hosting:

- Use the course promo code posted on Canvas Announcements and over Slack `#general` channel to register for an Individual account with [Reclaim Hosting](https://reclaimhosting.com/shared-hosting/). This is going to be your presonal server for the rest of the semester to build a website, submit assignments, use as a personal portfolio, etc. 
- You will have this server space at no cost for one year, after which you can renew your account for $30. 

> Many thanks to the University's [Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning](https://www.ucdenver.edu/tips/teaching-innovations/cetl) for providing a Teaching Enhancement Grant to Prof. Blevins to pay for your accounts! 

- As part of the registration process you will choose a website URL (domain name) that is specific to you - ex. `https://cameronblevins.org`. You have two options for the domain name:  
    - If you select "Register a new domain" you will pay $15 to register a domain name of your choosing that looks like: `https://cameronblevins.org (.com, .info, etc.)`. 
    - If you select "Use a subdomain from Reclaim Hosting" it does not cost any money but your domain will look like: `https://cameronblevins.reclaim.hosting`. 
    - Regardless of your choice, **I would highly recommend using some form of your name** so that you can use this as a personal website moving forward.
