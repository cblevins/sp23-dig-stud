title: Registering for a Reclaim Hosting Account

As part of this course you will be creating your own personal website that you will use during the semester for assignments and, eventually, to create a portfolio of your work that you can showcase after the semester ends. Rather than give you an account hosted by CU Denver (which you would lose access to after graduation), I have chosen to use Reclaim Hosting - a company explicitly geared towards giving students and others in education control over their own online hosting space.

Follow these instructions to register for an account with Reclaim Hosting:

- Click on the Student plan option [on this page](https://reclaimhosting.com/shared-hosting/).
- As part of the registration process you will choose a website URL (domain name) that is specific to you - ex. `https://cameronblevins.org`. You have **two options** for the domain name:  
    - If you select "Register a new domain" you will pay $15 to register a domain name of your choosing that looks like: `https://cameronblevins.org (.com, .info, etc.)`. 
    - If you select "Use a subdomain from Reclaim Hosting" it does not cost any money but your domain will look like: `https://cameronblevins.reclaim.hosting`. 
    - Regardless of your choice, **I would highly recommend using some form of your name** so that you can use this as a personal website moving forward. Imagine the eventual audience/reader of this site as a potential employer looking at your resume before a job interview.
- Use the course promo code posted on Canvas Announcements and over Slack `#general` channel during check-out, which will cover the $30 cost of an individual student plan.
- You will have this account for one year at no cost, after which you can renew your account for $30.
