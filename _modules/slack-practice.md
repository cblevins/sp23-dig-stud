Slack will be one of our main communication tools for the semester. To get you more comfortable using this platform, complete the following practice steps:

- [Make sure your profile is updated](https://slack.com/help/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-Slack-users#:~:text=1.-,fill%20out%20your%20profile,-Your%20profile%20will) with a profile picture and your preferred display name.  
- [A channel](https://slack.com/help/articles/360017938993-What-is-a-channel) is a space for communications dedicated to a specific topic or task.
	- I'll be using the `#in-class` channel to send out files or other material to use in class. **Navigate to the #in-class channel and download the PDF file that Prof. Blevins posted. **
- [Threads](https://slack.com/help/articles/115000769927-Use-threads-to-organize-discussions-) help you create organized discussions around specific messages. They let you discuss a topic in more detail without adding clutter to a channel or direct message (DM) conversation.
	- Navigate to the `#random` Slack channel and **answer Prof. Blevins’s question** using the “Reply in Thread” button.
- [Direct Messages](https://slack.com/help/articles/212281468-Understand-direct-messages) are smaller conversations in Slack (1-9 people) that happen outside of channels. DMs work well for one-off conversations that don’t require an entire channel of people to weigh in or that you would like to keep private.
	- Find out the name of the person immediately to your left (if nobody is to your left, ask the person in front or behind you). 
	- **Send a direct message** to that person and include Prof. Blevins as a recipient on the message.
- [Mentions](https://slack.com/help/articles/205240127-Use-mentions-in-Slack) are a way to directly reference someone in a thread or channel conversation. You can use this to respond to another person's comment or notify them of something that needs their attention.
	- Navigate to the thread you answered above in the `#random` channel, scroll through your classmates' answers, and write a message that @mentions someone whose answer you enjoyed.
- Slack is only effective if you are actively using it. Although not required, I would recommend downloading the Slack app to your phone ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Slack), [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/slack-app/id618783545?ls=1&mt=8)) and adding our course's Slack workspace to the app by using the email you used to initially join.
