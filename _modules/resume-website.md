Your goal is to build a page on your Wordpress site that will serve as a public-facing resume that you can use for potential employers.

- Log into your Wordpress dashboard and [create a new page](https://wordpress.org/support/article/pages/) titled "Resume" 
- Add the Resume page as [a link in your Wordpress site Navigation Menu](https://wordpress.com/support/site-editing/theme-blocks/navigation-block/) so that it a reader can navigate to it from your main site page.
- Add some resume content to your page:
	* Contact Information: Put your contact information at the top of your resume. It should include your name and email address. If you choose to use your University email address (@ucdenver.edu) remember that you might not have access to it after graduation.
	* Professional Summary: 3-4 sentences or bullet points highlighting transferable skills and what you are seeking in employment
	* Education: List most recent degree first; can include minors, certificates, GPA, honors, relevant courses, scholarships, awards, etc.
	* Relevant Experience: Work experience, leadership experience, volunteer experience. Include: position title, organization's name + location, & bullet points with action verbs about what you accomplished.
	* Skills: Include any technical, language, or other relevant skills. Such as Wordpress!
	* Projects (optional): If you have specific academic projects that you want to highlight, include them in their own section with detail on what you accomplished through the project that the person reading your resume should know.
	* Additional Activities (optional): university and community activities or organizations (including any offices held) and any other interests.
