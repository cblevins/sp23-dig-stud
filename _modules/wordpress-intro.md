Today you will be learning the basics of how to create a website using Wordpress, one of the most popular platforms for building websites. 

## Personal Website Warm-Up

In your group, divide up the following personal websites of people who are related to the class (author of a reading, speaking to our class, or involved with the Digital Studies Certificate) so that each person in your group is examining one website. Go through the website and think about what kind of **information** it includes, how it is **organized**, and what **message** it is sending about the person.

Once you've had a chance to explore your individual website, compare notes across the different websites (pull each of them up on your own machine):

- What are the similarities and differences in terms of **content**?
- What are similarities and differences in terms of **design and layout**?

## Familiarizing Yourself with Wordpress

I'm going to have you go through a few tutorials and then apply what you learned to your own site. The best way to learn is to try different things and see what happens!

### The Wordpress Dashboard

- Instructions for: [Navigating in Wordpress Dashboard](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wordpress/#Step_2__Navigating_in_WordPress_Dashboard_112)
- Change the Title and tagline of your site under `Settings -> General` Settings to something more appropriate (ex. Title: "Cameron Blevins" and Tagline: "History Professor") 
- Under `Settings -> Reading`, check the box next to `Search engine visibility` so that search engines like Google don't lead anyone to your site while you're still setting it up. 

### Create Your About Page

- Wordpress sites are made up of posts and pages. For the purposes of this class, we're going to be using pages rather than posts (which are for blogs rather than portfolio sites).
- Most personal websites have an About page that gives some information about the person. You're going to create an About page for your personal webpage.
- In the Wordpress Dashboard, click on Pages on the left side of the screen.
- You should see two existing pages already - these are pages that Wordpress automatically generated for your site when you installed it. 
- Click Add New either on the left sidebar or at the top of Pages 
- This brings up an Editor interface. This is the main interface you'll use to write and modify individual pages on your site - think of these as individual Word documents.
- Give your page a new title: `About`
- Click the plus sign `+` to add a new **"block"** - this is a discrete piece of your page such as a paragraph, image, etc. Click on Paragraph.
- Inside the blank block, write 1-2 sentences about yourself (your name, major, university, educational interets, etc.) - don't worry about sepcifics, you'll be refining this later!
- Make some of the words in your block **bold** and *italic*.
- Use the "Preview" option at the top to see how your page looks on your site
- Add an **image** to your About page:
	- Go back to the Editor and add a new image block with the plus sign (`+`) -> Image 
	- Insert an image from your computer. Choose any image, or just use the one you downloaded from Prof. Blevins last class (this is just a temporary placeholder to practice inserting images)
	- Click on the block and adjust the size of the image. you can do this directly in the block or specify the width and height of the image on the right side of the screen.
	- When you're done, click Publish button and then click View Page to see the new page.
- To make this About page appear as the landing page for your site, go to your Wordpress dashboard: `Settings -> Reading`, go to `Your homepage displays` and check `A static page`. Then select the newly created About page from the dropdown under `Homepage`.

### Clean up your Wordpress site

- Instructions: [Installing Wordpress Themes](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wordpress/#Step_5__Installing_WordPress_Themes_199)
-  Change the Theme of your Wordpress site to the `OceanWP` theme (install then activate the theme).
- Copy the URL of your page (it should look something like: `https://yourdomainname/test-page`) and send it to the person next to you over Slack DM.

### Bonus

- If you finish earlier than your classmates, see if you can figure out how to add a header image of your website that is [this image of the Denver skyline](https://cblevins.github.io/sp23-dig-stud/modules/denver-skyline.jpg). Try googling to find instructions or tips!
