## Course Description 

This course equips students to be effective and responsible users of digital technology. It does so through two pathways: one intellectual and the other practical. First, students will develop an intellectual framework for studying the role of digital platforms, software, applications, companies, and institutions within modern society, tackling larger topics like artificial intelligence, consumer privacy, and algorithmic bias. Second, students will learn how to use an array of digital tools and applications, such as website building, graphic design, video editing, audio recording, and processing, analyzing, and visualizing data.

*Note: This course serves as an introduction to the [Digital Studies Certificate](https://clas.ucdenver.edu/digital-studies-certificates/) and provides 3.0 approved credit hours within the Certificate's Integration cluster.*
