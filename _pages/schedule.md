### The Basics

#### Tue., Feb. 1: Computers and Files and Servers, Oh My!
- Register for a personal account and domain name with [Reclaim Hosting](https://reclaimhosting.com/shared-hosting/)
  - This URL will be your own personal domain that you will use in this class for assignments, but you can also use it moving forward as a professional website or portfolio. Think carefully about the domain name you choose. I would highly recommend using your name in the URL (ex. https://cameronblevins.org) You then have two options for the rest of the domain:      
    - If you select "Register a new domain" you will pay $15 to register a new domain of your choosing that looks like: https://cameronblevins.org (.com, .info, etc.). 
    - If you select "Use a subdomain from Reclaim Hosting" your domain will look like: https://cameronblevins.reclaim.hosting. but does not cost any additional money.
  - Cost: `$30` for the server space with Reclaim Hosting + either: `$0` for reclaim.hosting subdomain or `$15` for your choice of domain. This will be the only thing I will ask you to pay for during the semester (I hope).
