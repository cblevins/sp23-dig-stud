title: Video Editing with Adobe Premiere
---

## Introduction

The goal of today is continue to learn how to use the video editing software Adobe Premiere Pro. You are going to use this software to create a short (**roughly 1-2 minute**) video promo for this class.

## Your building blocks

Download the .zip file posted to the `#in-class` Slack channel and extract it to a sub-folder in your computer's folder for this class ([Windows instructions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/zip-and-unzip-files-f6dde0a7-0fec-8294-e1d3-703ed85e7ebc#:~:text=Open%20File%20Explorer%20and%20find,folder%20to%20a%20new%20location.), [Mac instructions](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/zip-and-unzip-files-and-folders-on-mac-mchlp2528/mac#:~:text=unzip%20(expand)%20a%20compressed%20item)). In this folder you will have the "building blocks" for making your video:

- Short video pitches each of you recorded (.mp4 files)
- Image to use as background (.jpeg file)
- Audio file with music sample (.mp3 file)

## Things to include

Your goal is to create a short video using the above building blocks that includes the following:

- Create and save a new project in Adobe Premiere Pro
- Choose two video segments recorded by your classmates to include in your promo 
- Import the two video files, the image file, and audio file into your project.
- Add the image file to your Timeline and have it play for the first 6 seconds of your video.
- Add the audio file to the Timeline so that it plays during those opening 6 seconds and then stops (you'll want to trim it in the Timeline).
- Add three text objects so that they are overlaid onto the image during the opening 6 seconds of the video:
  - Introduction to Digital Studies
  - HIST 3260/5260 - COMM 3081/5081
  - Professor Blevins - Spring 2023
- Add three of your classmates' videos to the Timeline so that they appear after the opening six seconds
- Trim several seconds from the beginning and/or end of at least one of your classmates' videos (ex. if there are several seconds of awkward silence at the beginning or end).
- End your video with 6 seconds of the image + overlaid course information again.
- Export your project content as a single new video file using the settings Format: `H.264` and Match Source: `Medium Bitrate`. Make sure to rename the Output Name to `yourfirstname-yourlastname-promo.mp4` and upload it to the #in-class Slack channel.

**Bonus:**

- Add transitions between the different sections of your video, such as and the opening image and in between your three videos. ([Tutorial](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/transition-overview-applying-transitions.html))
- Add an audio fade-in and fade-out at the beginning ([Tutorial](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/audio-transitions.html))
