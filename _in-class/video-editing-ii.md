title: Video Editing with Adobe Premiere II
---

## Introduction

The goal of today is continue to learn how to use the video editing software Adobe Premiere Pro. You are going to use this software to create a **1-2 minute video montage**: "Pets of Intro to Digital Studies." I'm intentionally leaving the instructions a bit more open-ended - I would encourage you to explore and troubleshoot any problems you run into together.

## Your building blocks

Download the .zip file posted to the `#in-class` Slack channel and extract it to a sub-folder in your computer's folder for this class ([Windows instructions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/zip-and-unzip-files-f6dde0a7-0fec-8294-e1d3-703ed85e7ebc#:~:text=Open%20File%20Explorer%20and%20find,folder%20to%20a%20new%20location.), [Mac instructions](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/zip-and-unzip-files-and-folders-on-mac-mchlp2528/mac#:~:text=unzip%20(expand)%20a%20compressed%20item)). In this folder I've included some files to get you started:

- A collection of image files of your pets that were posted to Slack at the beginning of the semester
- Audio file to use as background music (.mp3 file)

In addition to these files, download a few pet videos posted by your classmates on the `in-class` Slack channel.

## Things to include

Your goal is to create a short video that includes as much of the following as possible:

- A mix of videos, audio, images, and overlaid text (ex. "Pets of Intro to Digital Studies")
- Use the [Razor Tool](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/rearranging-clips-sequence.html#:~:text=Split%20or%20cut%20one%20or%20more%20clips%20with%20the%20Razor%20tool) to split one video in half, then place one of the images a pet in between the two split video segments.
- Add a Cross Disolve transition between two different videos ([Tutorial](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/transition-overview-applying-transitions.html))
- Add an audio fade-in and/or fade-out ([Tutorial](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/audio-transitions.html))
- Export your project content as a single new video file using the settings Format: `H.264` and Match Source: `Medium Bitrate`. Make sure to rename the Output Name to `yourlastname-pets.mp4` and upload it to the `#in-class` Slack channel.
